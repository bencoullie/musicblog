  {title: "Writing in Medium", content: "We set out to build the best publishing platform for on the web — or anywhere — for words and pictures, and that started with the writing experience itself. Here’s our approach and what we’ve built so far.\r\n\r\nWYSIWYG (Really)\r\n“Wiz-ee-wig” is short-hand in software for “what you see is what you get.” As I’m writing this, I see not just a WYSIWYG editor, I see the page I’m going to publish, which looks just like the version you’re reading. In fact, it is the version you’re reading. There’s no layer of abstraction. This is a simple (and old) concept, but I haven’t seen it in any other publishing tool—unless you count Google Docs and the like, where you’re basically always in editing mode (versus always in viewing mode). It makes a big difference. Having to go back and forth between your creation tool and your creation is like sculpting by talking.\r\n\r\nThere are those who would argue that when you’re writing, you’re creating the words—the story—not the presentation. Certainly, professional writers tend to be comfortable with that (perhaps because they know there’s a production process that will make their work look good). And there’s a good argument that content should be able to flow to many forms and presentations. I agree with that, but I still like writing in at least one of the many possible nice presentations.\r\n\r\nJust the Right Amount of Formatting\r\nConfession: One of the reasons its possible to have this really WYSIWYG experience is because we’ve stripped out a lot of the power that other editors give you. Here are things you can’t do: change fonts, font color, font size. You can’t insert tables or use strikethrough or even underline. Here’s what you can do:\r\n\r\nbold\r\nitalics\r\nsubheads (two levels)\r\nlinks\r\nlists\r\nblockquotes:\r\n“It’s true: Medium has the best web-based editor I’ve ever seen. And I’ve seen them all.” - Anil Dash\r\nThe way you do those things is by selecting some text, which causes a nice little toolbar to come up (you can also use keyboard shortcuts):\r\n\r\n\r\nThe in-context\r\nMedium toolbar\r\nAs you can see, you can also insert images. And if you want to display some code?\r\n\r\nYou can make it look like this by selecting the text and hitting ctrl+6.\r\nLastly, if you want a nice section separator, just hit return twice, which results in one of these:\r\n\r\nWhile we’ll be rolling out more formatting tools over time, the goal is to keep it very simple. I’m one of those people who will open up Word and spend half my time defining styles and adjusting the spacing between paragraphs. This is a terrible distraction and a waste of time—but it still feels necessary when the defaults aren’t good. With Medium, we’re making great defaults and letting you not worry about it.\r\n\r\nWhy format at all?\r\nI like tools like iA Writer. And I respect people who are geeky enough to write in Markdown comfortably. I don’t think most people are like that. Whenever I write in iA Writer, I get to a point where I really want to add links, italicize things, and create subheads. Seeing those things helps me think about what I’m writing by taking out a level of abstraction.\r\n\r\nI find that the happy medium (yes, I did that) between no formatting and full control is the most efficient and comfortable place to live. Once you get used to it, everything else feels like stepping back in time.\r\n\r\nTypographical Niceties\r\nI’m not a huge type geek—but some of my best friends are. There are a couple things I find important and a pain in the ass in many editors, though: Smart quotes (that’s “this” not \"this\") and em dashes (that’s — not -- ). The Medium editor makes both of these automatic.\r\n\r\nMore to Come\r\nWe have a bunch more ideas on how to make this editor even better—allowing people to let their brilliance and creativity flow smoothly onto the screen. We will evolve the editor to add power and flexibility without adding complexity or distraction.\r\n\r\nAlready, Medium has become my favorite place to write. (I may be slightly biased.) I hope it will soon be yours too.", user_id: 2},
  {title: "Furnishing a new story", content: "Several times recently I was asked what it feels like to begin writing a new book. I struggled for an answer until I remembered something. Two decades ago I was sitting in the completely empty living room of the new apartment we’d rented and in which we still live today. The movers were coming tomorrow to bring the furniture and other stuff. I had come to check things out a day early just in case something needed attention. After making sure all was okay, I sat down in the middle of the living room floor and looked around for a long time. The wooden floors had recently been refinished and the place smelled strongly of wax. The walls were newly painted white. Nothing else was there. What I remembered was how deeply satisfying it was to sit in that empty room, knowing in a day it would fill up with the furniture, objects, and various things of several peoples’ lives. This was going to be home for at least a few years and everyone in my family loved the big new space. Empty now, it was something in between— home but not yet. Ours but not quite. Virginal. Pure, but undoubtedly the apartment all of us wanted.\r\n\r\nThat is what it is like for me to begin writing a new novel. You’ve chosen a place to live for the next years but it has nothing inside it yet. Only the walls, floors and windows. Because you have specifically chosen this space, now you must furnish it. But you’re really looking forward to the task, no matter how long it takes. The other day I heard an interview with the writer Junot Diaz who said it took eleven years to write his last novel. Eleven years, two years, six months— it doesn’t matter. The writer chooses a specific space to inhabit. Next his task is to fill it with the best, the *only* furniture he knows how to make or find. If he is lucky and does it well, whoever comes to visit when it is finished will hopefully be delighted with the way it has been done and want to stay there a long time.", user_id: 1},
  {title: "Medium a shit (admin post)", content: "There’s a lot happening on Medium these days.\r\n\r\nMore people than ever are sharing their stories and ideas — from little tales that make your day better to manifestos that change the world. Everyone from professional journalists to amateur storytellers and non-profit leaders are writing on Medium everyday.\r\n\r\nIt’s safe to say that we’ve only just begun. And we want you to as well. So if you’ve got something to share, jump in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you want to learn more, here are a few things to know.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.\r\nMedium is the best writing experience online.\r\nMedium’s composing tool is truly what-you-see-is-what-you-get and has just the right amount of formatting to tell your stories without getting in the way. It’s simple, beautiful, and collaborative. There are no gratuitous sidebars, plug-ins, or widgets. There is nothing to set up or customize. When you write on Medium, you’ll know that your words and pictures will look great on any device; they’ll automatically adjust to the latest technology and even get better over time. If you have content from elsewhere, you can simply import it:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2.\r\nYou’re in good company.\r\nOn Medium, you’re not alone. You write beside and with other people. At the heart of Medium is the idea that people create better things together. Even professional writers need editors, and Medium makes it easy to get help before you hit the “Publish” button. These same tools let readers engage by offering feedback and ideas in context. The message is yours to control, with the tools to enlist the help you need.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3.\r\nFind your audience, grow it, and come back to it.\r\nWe think great ideas can come from anywhere and should compete on their own merits. When you join Medium, you can both bring and build your audience — one that you can return to publish to anytime. Posts get spread around based on interest and engagement, with the help of algorithmic and editorial curation. And either way, you’re publishing into a thriving, pulsing network — not a standalone web site, which you alone are responsible for keeping alive.\r\n\r\nIf you’re in search of a more comprehensive look into Medium’s tools, check out our very own Marcin Wichary’s post here:", user_id: 3}
